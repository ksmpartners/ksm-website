## Mike Harnish

CEO

Somewhere between an undergraduate degree in philosophy and a planned stint in graduate school, Mike’s professional interests turned to consulting, systems integration, and software development. After twelve years split between Accenture, First Consulting Group, and a high-tech start-up, Mike co-founded KSM as a vehicle to deliver high-value expertise-based software services to clients in the life sciences industries.

In recent years, Mike led KSM into the utilities industry. An unrepentant generalist, Mike has delivered client/server solutions on Windows, web-based applications on a number of Java servers, and integration solutions from full-stack ESBs to minimalist REST frameworks. His current interests include the Scala programming language, cloud computing, and leveraging technology to build the agile company. Mike earned that BA in Philosophy with honors from Swarthmore College.
