# Test Automation

We have decades of experience with test automation on projects of all sizes. The front-loaded investment in test automation pays huge dividends in both agility and maintainability as the system evolves over time.

### Reduce software delivery time

The accelerated trend toward continuous delivery of software solutions demands test automation. There is no point in re-engineering your software delivery processes if every release requires weeks or months of manual system and acceptance testing.

### Expand unit and acceptance testing

KSM can help you automate testing in every phase of your development process, from unit through acceptance testing. We can help you leverage the power of the cloud to spin up a cost-effective, global, distributed load and performance testing infrastructure.

### Improve software quality

Test automation reveals defects earlier in the software development lifecycle when it is more cost effective to resolve them.
